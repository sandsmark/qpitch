1.0:
 * New version forked from K3Guitune in order to obtain a cross-platform
 application. The new name of the application is QPitch. The authors of the
 original application suggested a rename.
 * The description of the changes is given with respect to K3Guitune 1.0
 * Removed all KDE dependencies in order to obtain a cross-platform application.
 * Removed all OSS/ARTS/ALSA/JACK code and replaced with PortAudio library
 which is cross-platform. The initialization of the peripheral uses the same
 parameters. Now the audio input is based on a callback function which is
 triggered when the buffer is full.
 * Switched to Qt4 to take advantage of its new capabilites.
 * Added a preference windows to select sample frequency, buffer size,
 reference frequency for A4 and musical notation.
 * Removed all the code needed to create the GUI and replaced with a .ui file
 obtained with Qt-Designer.
 * Fixed QOsziView and QLogView to redraw all the widget only when really
 needed.
 * Fixed auto-correlation computation to obtain a cleaner code.
 * Dropped translations... too bad!!
 * All this code has been contributed by William Spinelli

1.0.1:

 Schl√∂mer)
